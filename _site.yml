            We know that Hawaii is remote and we had very little time to prepare.

            For the ones that are coming, we are very excited to see you there!

            We met at a friend’s wedding in 2011.  Leo was living in Rio de
            Janeiro and Carol had just moved to Ribeirão Preto. We dated  long
            distance for 3 years. In 2014, Carol moved to Rio to do her PhD and
            we moved in together. In 2016, Carol went to Stony Brook to fulfill
            her dream of living abroad. A few months later, Leo moved to Hawaii
            for a postdoc. The idea was to try to be a little bit closer, but
            it turns out to be about as far away as was Rio.  We don’t know
            where we’ll be or what we’ll do in the future.  What we do know is
            that we love each other and we will be together again next year no
            matter what.
            </p>
            <p>
            It’s always better when we’re together!

            Our wedding will be a simple party (almost a picnic) at a beach
            park.
            <br>
            We’ll provide non-alcoholic drinks and food, including dairy-free
            and vegetarian options.
            </p>
            <h3>Where</h3>
            We are still deciding between a few beaches in eastern
            Oahu. We will update this information soon.
            <h3>When</h3>
            Saturday - August 26th, 2017 at 3:30 p.m.
            <h3>Dress code</h3>
            None.
            <br>
            We want that you feel comfortable, so you’re free to choose
            the best outfit for you.
            <br>
            Just remember that we will be at the beach
            in the afternoon and it will probably be very hot.
            <h3>Why</h3>
            You might be a little confused right now.
            <em>Weren’t they are married? Why such a hurry? Why Hawaii?</em>
            <br>
            We have a “civil union”, which is almost exactly the same as a
            marriage in Brazil for all practical purposes. But the U.S.
            government doesn’t recognize it if we want to get a VISA, so that
            would be a problem if Carol is to come live in Hawaii next year. Of
            course, we were planning to get married anyway when we got
            together again but this was an amazing pretext to do it in Hawaii.
            Not too bad, right?

            Your presence is the only gift that we want. We’re not living
            together right now so we don’t need anything for the house. We
            really appreciate your advices and hugs. So send us messages, give
            out lots of hugs, or prepare a speech for the ceremony. If you are
            not able to join us in Hawaii, you are more than welcome to
            participate here with messages too.
            </p>
            <p>
            If you still really want to give us something, a small contribution
            towards our honeymoon would be appreciated.
