                He is a geophysicist, a professor, a programmer. He is a
                walking wikipedia, he is sweet (but not with everybody), he is
                the rational one. He likes traveling and ginger.

                She is a biologist, a teacher. She has more names than
                Daenerys, she is a dreamer, she is the emotional one. She likes
                dancing, talking, and chocolate.

            We met at a friend’s wedding in 2011.
            Leo was living in Rio de Janeiro and Carol had just moved to
            Ribeirão Preto. We dated  long distance for 3 years. In 2014, Carol
            moved to Rio to do her PhD and we moved in together. In 2016, Carol
            went to Stony Brook to fulfill her dream of living abroad. A few
            months later, Leo moved to Hawaii for a postdoc. The idea was to
            try to be a little bit closer, but it turns out to be about as far
            away as was Rio. We don’t know where we’ll be or what we’ll do.
            What we do know is that we love each other and we will be together
            again next year no matter what. It’s always better when we’re
            together!
